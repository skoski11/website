Baseball Facts
First Fact, I absolutely hate baseball.

Now here is some hard data:

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='PHI' and yearID>=1970 and yearID<=1979 and HR>= 30"
sqldf(query)

query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and HR> 40"
sqldf(query)

query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,SO FROM Batting
WHERE HR> 40 and SO<=60"
sqldf(query)

```

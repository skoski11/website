#Example of using SQLDF to Query
These are a few examples of running queries and how to select certain sets of data
and also choosing which directories to search the data from, and then run an sqldf
to run the results and display the query. Another technique used in these is sorting
the data we display using the WHERE statement to make specific requirements for the data
to meet in order to be displayed
```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='PHI' and yearID>=1970 and yearID<=1979 and HR>= 30"
sqldf(query)

query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and HR> 40"
sqldf(query)

query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,SO FROM Batting
WHERE HR> 40 and SO<=60"
sqldf(query)
```

#How to Order by Descending
This chunk of code is an example that shows a way to order the final results
In a descending order, as opposed to the default asceding order it would
return the data in.
```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE HR>50
ORDER BY HR DESC"
sqldf(query)
```
#Searching with more criteria
This query is an example where we searched for the players who had the fewest 
Strike outs in a single season, but we used another criteria that they had to have
also had atleast 400 at bats in the season as well.
```{r}
# This finds and sorts who has had the fewest strikeouts in a season with atleast 400 at bats
query<-"SELECT teamID, playerID, yearID, SO, AB FROM Batting
WHERE AB>= 400 and SO< 10
ORDER BY SO"
sqldf(query)
```

#Searching for all information of Specific player
This line of code is an example of specifically queing for the information
about a certain player. You must find what the specific player's ID is so 
you can search specifically for that person's information if you search and group 
information based on the player's ID
```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,sum(HR) FROM Batting
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'
GROUP BY playerID"
sqldf(query)
```
#Filtering with Grouping versus HAving

This is a very important mechanic when it comes to searching for data. When you filter 
specific information, you use the term WHERE if you filter before grouping data.If you are grouping
AFTER you group information, then you use the HAVING command to filter information. This also uses a relatively new
technique of gathering the sum of one of the results. In this, they sum the total number of HR's and groups it by ID's
of each player
```{r}
#Filter before group is where, and filter after group uses having
query<-"SELECT playerID,sum(HR) FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(HR)>= 600
ORDER BY sum(HR) DESC"
sqldf(query)
```

#Use of Average function
This query shows the use of the avg function which is used similariliy to the sum function
except it gathers the avg instead of the sum of the numbers.
```{r}
#sum() avg() max() min() are all useable fucntions
query<-"SELECT playerID,avg(HR) FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING avg(HR)>= 30
ORDER BY avg(HR) DESC"
sqldf(query)
```
#Drawing from multiple index at once
This next series of data queries involve a new mechanic we learned that involves
drawing data from multiple different index at one time. In this, one of the issues
is where multiple index have the same information, and you must make a comparison
to equate the two ID's. In this case, the playerID is connected in Batting and Master.
```{r}
#This is us testing how to draw from multiple index at one
#Time and combine responses from these
query<-"SELECT nameFirst, nameLast, teamID, yearID, HR
FROM Batting INNER JOIN Master
On Batting.playerID=Master.playerID
WHERE Batting.playerID='ruthba01'"
sqldf(query)
#Draw from two queries
```

#Drawing from 2 sources and overwriting specific Information
This is another example where the draw from two queries, and in this one they replace
the playerID so that the First and Last name are displayed instead
```{r}
#Drew from two querries and replaced playerID with
#Real name
query<-"SELECT nameFirst, nameLast, teamID, yearID, HR
FROM Batting INNER JOIN Master
On Batting.playerID=Master.playerID
WHERE HR> 50
ORDER BY HR DESC"
sqldf(query)
```
#Replace multiple datas with new data
This continues to build on what we worked on in the last query, and it will replace both
the player and the teams full names
```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,name,Batting.yearID, Batting.HR
FROM Batting INNER JOIN Teams
On Batting.teamID=Teams.teamID and Batting.yearID=Teams.yearID
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"
sqldf(query)
```

#Combining everything We have Learned
This is an extensive combination of most of what we have learned and it combines 3 different
index information, and it compares them specifically. In the SELECT portion we specify that the yearID and HR's will be selected from the Batting index. This will provide all the information about Babe Ruth.
```{r}
#This gives all the full data of all of Babe Ruth's Seasons with whole
#Names for his teams and himself
query<-"SELECT nameFirst,nameLast,name,Batting.yearID,Batting.HR 
FROM (Batting INNER JOIN Master
On Batting.playerID=Master.playerID) INNER JOIN Teams
On Batting.teamID=Teams.teamID AND Batting.yearID=Teams.yearID
WHERE Batting.playerID ='ruthba01'"
sqldf(query)
```

#More final Examples
These next two functions continue to combine everything we have learned. It practices grouping, collecting sums from specific indexes, and ordering the data in different areas
that range from number of home runs to the salaries of the players, or even just their 
first name. 
```{r}
#Finds all people ever with over 600 career homeruns and gives their full name
#and team name
query<-"SELECT nameFirst,nameLast,name,sum(Batting.HR),Batting.yearID 
FROM (Batting INNER JOIN Master
On Batting.playerID=Master.playerID) INNER JOIN Teams 
On Batting.teamID=Teams.teamID AND Batting.yearID=Teams.yearID
GROUP BY Batting.playerID
HAVING sum(Batting.HR)>= 600
ORDER BY sum(Batting.HR) DESC"
sqldf(query)
```


```{r}
#Finds people with the average salary over 1 million and the name BOB
query<-"SELECT namefirst,nameLast, avg(salary)
FROM Salaries INNER JOIN Master
On Salaries.playerID=Master.playerID
WHERE nameFirst='Bob'
GROUP BY Salaries.playerID
HAVING avg(salary) > 1000000
ORDER BY avg(salary) DESC" 
sqldf(query)

```

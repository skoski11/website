These are examples of ques run that gather different data and also show how we can organize how the information will be displayed, example the 4th one.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='PHI' and yearID>=1970 and yearID<=1979 and HR>= 30"
sqldf(query)

query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and HR> 40"
sqldf(query)

query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,SO FROM Batting
WHERE HR> 40 and SO<=60"
sqldf(query)

query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE HR>50
ORDER BY HR DESC"
sqldf(query)
```
